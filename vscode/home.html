                Being my first step in my career I have faced alot of ups and downs accordingly as me being young
                and at the same time a female in the tech field was quite the most challenges i faced. This has made me to exploit and learn various things that never once did i think i could experience them.<br> At times it got tough n thought maybe i should quit'<strong> Emmanuel Damalie's EPISTlES OF REALITIES</strong> occupied my mind which is
                "<strong>Persistence Breaks Resistence</strong>" and i could just feel reborn. So in whatever you do please persist don't stop.<br><br>
