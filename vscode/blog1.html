    <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;" class="first"><strong>In todayâ€™s digital age, software is an integral part of our daily lives</strong>. We use it for work, entertainment,
        communication, and much more. However, the high cost of some software can make it tempting to turn to pirated
        versions. Pirated software refers to software that has been illegally copied, distributed, or sold without the
        permission of the copyright holder. While it may seem like a cost-effective solution, using pirated software can
        have serious consequences. In this article, we will discuss why you should not use pirated software on your
        computer.</p>

    <div id = body>
        <div class="column">
        <p> <strong> 1. Legal Consequences</strong>
        Using pirated software is illegal and c

        an result in severe legal consequences. Copyright infringement is a serious offense, and those caught using
        pirated software can face hefty fines and even imprisonment in some cases. Companies that create software invest
        a lot of time, money, and resources in developing their products, and using pirated software is a violation of
        their intellectual property rights.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="column">
        <p> <strong>2. Security Risks</strong>
        Pirated software is often obtained from u

        ntrusted sources and may contain malware or viruses. These viruses can damage your computer, steal your personal
        information, and compromise your security. Pirated software is often modified to include additional features or
        remove copy protection, making it vulnerable to hacking and other malicious activities.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="column">
        <p><strong> 3. No Technical Support</strong>
        When you purchase legitimate software, you receive technical support from the manufacturer or vendor. They can
        assist you with any issues or problems you may encounter while using the software. However, with pirated
        software, you do not have access to technical support. This means that if you encounter



        any problems, you will have to rely on online forums and user groups for assistance, which may not always be
        reliable or accurate.
    </p>
    </div>

        <div class="column">
        <p><strong>4. No Updates</strong>
        Software companies release updates and patches to fix bugs, improve functionality, and enhance security.
        However, with pirated software, you do not receive these updates. This means that you are stuck with an outdated
        version of the software, which may contain security vulnerabilities and other issues.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="column">
        <p><strong>5. Ethical Considerations</strong>
        Using pirated software is not only illegal, but it is also unethical. It is a form of theft that harms the
        software industry and the people who work in it. It is important to remember that software development is a
        complex and time-consuming process that requires a lot of hard work and dedication. By using pirated software,
        you are essentially taking advantage of the hard work of others without compensating them for their efforts.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="column">
      <p> <strong>In conclusion</strong>, using pirated software on your computer may seem like a cost-effective solution, but it is not
        worth the potential legal, security, and ethical consequences. It is important to purchase legitimate software
        and support the software industry and the people who work in it. By doing so, you can ensure that you have
        access to high-quality software that is safe, secure, and up-to-date</p>
